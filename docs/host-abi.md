# Waffle host ABI

Waffle exposes browser-side capabilities to WebAssembly guests without requiring a second runtime owner. The page creates one `createRuntime()` instance, and workers receive borrowed filesystem and process capabilities through explicit bootstrap messages.

## Ownership

`SharedFilesystem` owns the worker, storage backend, identity allocator and service lifetime. A process receives a `FilesystemIdentity` and descriptor bindings; it never receives the page's filesystem owner or its disposal method. `Runtime.dispose()` fences admitted filesystem work, stops consumers only after quiescence, closes owned services last, and releases the duplicate-bundle ownership guard.

## Process admission

`BrowserProcessBroker` reserves identities and descriptor bindings synchronously, then activates the lazy supervisor. Worker bootstrap receives a compiled module, argv, environment, filesystem connection and optional process transport. Source bytes must pass interruption admission; a precompiled module is accepted only with explicit cooperative execution.

## Process identity import

`runtime_proc.getpid: () -> i32` returns the calling process's own positive runtime PID,
not its parent PID or job ID. `ProcessABI` reads its already-bound `options.pid` directly;
the call takes no arguments, reads no guest memory, never waits and sends no service or
broker request. In-process and worker adapters expose the same import. It adds no eager
process-service activation, helper export or RPC operation.

## Executable access queries

`runtime_proc.access_start(path_ptr, path_len, cwd_ptr, cwd_len, mode)` copies both UTF-8
strings before returning. `cwd` must be absolute and `mode` must be X_OK (`1`); other modes,
invalid UTF-8, empty strings and NUL bytes return `-EINVAL` (`-28`). The returned positive
request ID belongs to the calling process. `access_take(request)` is `-EAGAIN` (`-6`) until
the asynchronous registry/filesystem check publishes, then consumes the request and returns
zero or `-ENOENT` (`-44`), `-EACCES` (`-2`), or `-ENOTDIR` (`-54`). `access_cancel` retires
ownership and causes a late completion to be discarded. Unknown or consumed IDs return
`-EBADF` (`-8`). There are at most 64 live requests per process, and process death retires
all of them. Queries call the same live `ExecutableRegistry.check(name, cwd)` used by spawn,
without activating the module loader, supervisor, filesystem descriptors, or process launch.
The result is point-in-time: spawn checks the live file and registration again, so an earlier
success cannot authorize an unlinked or unregistered program. Other filesystem failures retain
their WASI errno (unexpected failures are EIO, never invented ENOENT).

The process broker owns worker requests because the filesystem worker has no executable registry.
Reusing filesystem request kind 3 would couple storage to the optional process/module graph.
Cooperative in-process guests use the same imports through their existing `ProcessSupervisor`,
with the same registry check, result codes, 64-request bound and take/cancel/death ownership.
Request maps and worker completion cells are created only on first use; there is no registry
snapshot or activation of another supervisor. The imports never await, call `Atomics.wait`,
compile, spawn, or allocate descriptors.

Poll kind 5 subscribes to an executable query request ID. Both adapters store the result before
publishing completion and increment their ABI's common wake sequence only after publication,
so a completion racing `poll` cannot be lost. `ProcessABI` forwards its supplied shared `wake`
word to the in-process query service; worker clients use their process directory's wake word.
Cancellation and process death do not publish a late completion.

## Transport contracts

Filesystem and process transports use shared-memory completion and readiness words plus message-port control. Descriptor bindings retain independent capability pins while duplicate bindings may share an open-file cursor. Termination selects one atomic outcome; cleanup acknowledgement and filesystem quiescence are separate facts.

Process startup failures use a third atomic outcome tag. `ENOENT` carries code 2,
`EACCES` carries code 13, and both have `status: null`; ordinary exits 126 and 127
remain ordinary exits. `runtime_proc.wait` and `wait_job` map the typed outcomes to
127 and 126 while preserving the typed result for browser and host adapters.
The initial worker request carries the authoritative outcome view before any
dynamic process import. Startup errors select typed EACCES; after WASI execution
begins, failures retain an ordinary execution exit.
The instantiate phase and executor ready hook run only after validating the
callable `_start` export and the exported WebAssembly memory. A later exit notice
or numeric completion cannot replace the atomic typed startup outcome.

## Process collection and reuse

Process and job identities are monotonically allocated, non-wrapping incarnations;
shared directory slots are recyclable storage, not identities. Captured process
and job controls carry their incarnation in the same atomic word as the value.
A late Worker cannot adopt a replacement's authority by retaining a shared view.
An outcome is selected only against its process-specific running sentinel, so a
late exit or signal cannot replace a successor's outcome.

`runtime_proc.wait(pid, out)` consumes one direct child's terminal outcome. It
returns `-EAGAIN` (`-6`) while the child or its resource/filesystem cleanup fence is
pending. Success writes the existing 8-byte little-endian kind/code record and
immediately releases that child's shared process slot, independently of its job.
A subsequent wait, or a wait for a non-child, returns `-ECHILD` (`-12`). Pipe-owner
metadata has been released by the cleanup fence; a consuming wait never retains it.
An exited but uncollected child remains a zombie and retains process capacity.
Choosing an outcome alone is not proof that a Worker's resources are safe to release.

Poll kind 2 observes a child's readiness through
`ProcessService.childExited(parentPid, pid): boolean`; it never consumes the exit
or releases capacity. Repeated readiness polls leave exactly one successful `wait`
available. The host-side observation throws ECHILD for a collected or non-child
PID (guest poll returns `-12`). Host `wait` is consuming too; `waitForExit` remains
an asynchronous observation, and explicit host `reap` also consumes a child.

`wait_job` consumes a completed job and releases its remaining shared process
slots. Host records are reconciled by subsequent broker receipts or pumping;
physical host-map cleanup is not synchronous with a Worker's consuming return.
Its nonblocking form reports pending until every live member and its cleanup
fence has settled. Job-empty polling is observational. A job keeps its
leader's typed outcome independently of the leader's process row, and completed
members do not remain in its live membership. Shared job collection is helpable
if a collector stops; host cleanup also reconciles the shared state without
requiring a final Worker notification. An unconsumed completed job deliberately
retains its job row and cached outcome until its consuming wait.

`wait_job(job, flags, out)` keeps the existing arguments and 4-byte status result;
flags `1` is nonblocking and `0` blocks. Collecting every direct child with `wait`
does **not** consume its job: `wait_job(job, 1, out)` returns `-EAGAIN` while any
descendant member or its cleanup fence remains pending, then succeeds using the
cached leader outcome after all members finish. Only consuming `wait_job` itself
makes a repeat return `-ECHILD`. Unknown job IDs return `-ESRCH` (`-71`). Spawn
selectors are unchanged: `0` and `-1` create foreground/background jobs, and a
positive selector joins an existing live job.

Host control fields in `ProcessContext`, `SignalTransport`, `SpawnReservation`
and `ProcessABIOptions.wait` use `ControlCells` (`Int32Array | TaggedCells`). Outcome
fields use `OutcomeWord` (`BigInt64Array | OutcomeCell`); `claimOutcome` and
`readOutcome` accept that union, so consumers must use those helpers rather than
raw atomics on outcome fields. `SpawnReservation` also carries optional
`controlParent` and `rootPid`; `SharedJobIdentity` carries optional `controlParent`.
Captured stale tagged controls/outcomes throw `ProcessError(SRCH = 71)` and cannot
read or change the next occupant of the recycled slot. These are matching-package
host contracts, not version-negotiation paths.

Parent retirement collects completed children and forwards live descendants'
controlling ancestry, preserving permitted signal and wait authority through
compressed control-parent links. Immutable root ownership separately retains the
controller, output, and shutdown lifetime after intermediate controllers disappear;
it does not grant arbitrary ancestors signal authority while a direct owner lives.

Pipe publication owners are enrolled before descriptor export under the spawn
admission fence. Owner collection freezes old cursors and releases owner metadata;
a delayed Worker cannot reenroll a collected identity. Cursor cells themselves
are not reused: retained endpoint views have no cursor-incarnation field, and the
separate cursor arena remains bounded at 16,777,216 cells (256 MiB).

## Network and preview

The network helper performs injected `fetch` operations and writes responses to a shared ring. The host side exposes nonblocking handles and preview HTTP framing. Preview routing and service-worker registration are consumer policies; Waffle exports the routing and protocol services without choosing a URL scope.

## Compatibility

Waffle does not promise compatibility with an older runtime package or a stale consumer. Consumers pin one exact Git commit and use the matching exports and lockfile.
