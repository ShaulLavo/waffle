# Waffle host ABI

Waffle exposes browser-side capabilities to WebAssembly guests without requiring a second runtime owner. The page creates one `createRuntime()` instance, and workers receive borrowed filesystem and process capabilities through explicit bootstrap messages.

## Ownership

`SharedFilesystem` owns the worker, storage backend, identity allocator and service lifetime. A process receives a `FilesystemIdentity` and descriptor bindings; it never receives the page's filesystem owner or its disposal method. `Runtime.dispose()` fences admitted filesystem work, stops consumers only after quiescence, closes owned services last, and releases the duplicate-bundle ownership guard.

## Process admission

`BrowserProcessBroker` reserves identities and descriptor bindings synchronously, then activates the lazy supervisor. Worker bootstrap receives a compiled module, argv, environment, filesystem connection and optional process transport. Source bytes must pass interruption admission; a precompiled module is accepted only with explicit cooperative execution.

## Transport contracts

Filesystem and process transports use shared-memory completion and readiness words plus message-port control. Descriptor bindings retain independent capability pins while duplicate bindings may share an open-file cursor. Termination selects one atomic outcome; cleanup acknowledgement and filesystem quiescence are separate facts.

Process startup failures use a third atomic outcome tag. `ENOENT` carries code 2,
`EACCES` carries code 13, and both have `status: null`; ordinary exits 126 and 127
remain ordinary exits. `runtime_proc.wait` and `wait_job` map the typed outcomes to
127 and 126 while preserving the typed result for browser and host adapters.
The initial worker request carries the authoritative outcome view before any
dynamic process import. Startup errors select typed EACCES; failures after the
worker's instantiate phase retain an ordinary execution exit.

## Network and preview

The network helper performs injected `fetch` operations and writes responses to a shared ring. The host side exposes nonblocking handles and preview HTTP framing. Preview routing and service-worker registration are consumer policies; Waffle exports the routing and protocol services without choosing a URL scope.

## Compatibility

Waffle does not promise compatibility with an older runtime package or a stale consumer. Consumers pin one exact Git commit and use the matching exports and lockfile.
